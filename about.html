       <p>Hello, my name is Jerry Joseph and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Florida International University, where I developed a strong foundation in technology and problem-solving.</p>
       <p>Alongside my academic pursuits, I serve as a young minister at New Direction Christian Center, where I have such a passion guiding and supporting others on their spiritual journey in Christ Jesus. Outside of my professional and spiritual roles, I'm deeply passionate about biblical studies and the history within the bible. Exploring the depths of scripture and unraveling its historical context fascinates me to no end.</p>
       <p>In my free time, you'll often find me engrossed in both biblical studies and honing my skills in front-end development. This strikes a balance between these two pursuits, which brings me a unique sense of fulfillment and keeps me engaged in continuous learning and growth.</p>
       <p>If you want to get in touch with me, the best way is to email me at lovingthetruthltt@gmail.com</p>
